Senior Staff Software Engineer with a passion for building scalable frontend systems, design platforms, and high-performing engineering teams. At Kyruus, I've led cross-functional efforts to modernize web architecture, revamp our design system (Biome), and influence the long-term direction of our frontend platform.

My strength lies in translating complex technical challenges into clear, maintainable solutionsâ€”and mentoring engineers along the way. I thrive at the intersection of frontend excellence, platform engineering, and developer experience. With over 10 years of experience designing and developing multi-tier applications, I'm a meticulous documenter focused on ensuring applications are simple and easy to follow using process diagrams, code comments, and most importantly, clean code.

Specializing in design systems \& component architecture, frontend platforms \& micro-frontend strategy, technical leadership \& mentorship, and developer experience, observability, and web performance.
